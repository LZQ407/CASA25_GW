## Project Summary

This project visualizes seasonal habitat use of the migratory White-naped Crane across East Asia. By integrating GPS tracking data with environmental indicators such as vegetation, temperature, pollution, and water availability, the application identifies critical hotspots and evaluates their ecological quality. Designed for conservation practitioners, the tool supports science-based advocacy by enabling users to generate evidence that informs policy and habitat protection. Built on Google Earth Engine, it offers an accessible, interactive interface to explore temporal patterns and argue for conservation priorities at regional and national levels.

### Problem Statement

Migratory species like the White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) rely on multiple seasonal habitats across East Asia for survival. However, many of these areas—especially temporary stopover sites—are under threat from agricultural expansion, urban development, and climate variability (Wilcove and Wikelski, 2008). These habitats often fall outside existing protected areas and are ecologically important only during specific time windows. Because such spatiotemporal dynamics are difficult to observe and document, conservationists face challenges in presenting compelling scientific evidence that justifies habitat protection (Yanco et al., 2024; Runge et al., 2014).

### End User

Our application is designed for conservationists and environmental NGOs who seek to protect migratory bird habitats. These users often struggle to communicate the ecological significance of dynamic, short-lived stopover areas to government bodies. By combining animal movement data with seasonal environmental indicators, our tool enables users to extract spatial evidence that supports conservation claims. This helps bridge the gap between scientific data and policy advocacy, empowering practitioners to argue more effectively for new or extended habitat protections (Rose et al., 2018).

### Data

We integrate multi-source remote sensing and ecological tracking datasets. White-naped Crane movement data comes from the “White-naped Crane Mongolia WSCC” study (Batbayar et al., 2024), which provides high-resolution GPS data via the Movebank Repository. Environmental conditions are assessed using MODIS NDVI for vegetation, ERA5 for temperature, Sentinel-5P for pollution levels, and GLCF for inland water extent. Nature reserve boundaries are sourced from the Protected Planet database, which provides standardized, globally updated information on protected areas. Together, these datasets allow us to quantify the environmental quality of crane habitats across space and time (Turner et al., 2003).

### Methodology

We identify high-density crane hotspots using kernel-based smoothing of GPS point data. These areas are then evaluated using seasonal environmental metrics that correspond to ecological niche components such as vegetation availability, thermal conditions, water presence, and air quality (Yanco et al., 2024). The application allows users to select regions, filter by administrative or ecological criteria, and retrieve environmental summaries for any identified hotspot. This supports ecological comparisons across space, time, and protection status, making it easier to assess threats and justify targeted conservation actions.

### Interface

The application is built on Google Earth Engine, offering a user-friendly interface for non-programmer conservation professionals. Users can explore interactive maps, filter hotspots by administrative boundaries or nature reserve proximity, and view detailed statistics by clicking on regions. A date slider enables seasonal comparison, while visualizations of NDVI, temperature, and pollution provide ecological context. By translating complex spatiotemporal data into actionable insights, the interface bridges the gap between ecological research and policy impact (Rose et al., 2018; Collen et al., 2013). The tool is intended to enhance the ability of users to advocate effectively for the protection of high-priority crane habitats.

## How it Works

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

``` js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math: $$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
